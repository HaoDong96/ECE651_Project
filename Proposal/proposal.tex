	\section{Non-functional properties}
		The application architecture can be roughly divided into three separated parts: a data collection system, a frontend website which let users to query housing data, and a backend web server with database as a middleware, connecting the previous ones together. Therefore, we expect this application to have great heterogeneity and scalability regarding non-functional properties.

		\subsection{Heterogeneity}
		 In our team we have different people who are experienced in web spider, data retrieving and analyzing, server building and frontend delivering respectively. Also, different programming languages/techniques are involved in this single project. Under this circumstance, we especially care about the heterogeneity of the solution. Besides the advantage of easy-to-test and potential of modularization, adequate heterogeneity in this architecture allows us to do the job in a parallel way.

		\subsection{Scalability}
		In the long term plan we
